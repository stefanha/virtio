INTRODUCTION
===============
1. Remove The entire first paragraph with the exveption of the first
sentence.
2. Replace with - A virtual device in its truest sense is not any different
from a physical device. The virtual machine sees a virtual device just as a
physical machine would see a physical one. As such, this document will treat
virtual devices as physical devices.
3. The purpose of ...
4. replace rather than using boutique to  rather than using vendor-specific,
per-environment, or per-OS mechanisms. 

5. ADD -The categories described above are further defined as follows:
  Straightforward: Revise last sentence to read - There aren’t any exotic
page-flipping or COW mechanisms and it functions as a  normal device.[1]
6. Efficient: ADD to input and output (I/O),
7. effects from both guest and (not sure but i think you should ADD host)
device writing to the same cache
  lines.
8. Standard: CHANGE TO READ: Virtio makes no assumptions about the
environment in which
  it operates, beyond what is required in order to allow the bus to  attach
the host device to the driver on the guest.  Virtio
  devices are implemented over PCI and other buses, and earlier drafts that
  have been implemented on other buses not included in this specification.[2]

 from the specific virtio drivers: these drivers are shared with
 the non-PCI implementations (currently lguest and S/390).
