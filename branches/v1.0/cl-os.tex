clean up virtqueue layout definitions

Generalize "Legacy Interfaces: A Note on Virtqueue Layout" to allow
for different alignment requirements. Have pci and ccw refer to that
section for legacy devices. Remove the double definition of virtqueue
alignment (which referred to legacy, but was not tagged as such) from
the ccw section.
See \ref{
}.

ccw: allow WRITE_STATUS to fail
    
We want to be able to fail setting a status on the device
(e.g.  FEATURES_OK if the device can't work with the features
negotiated).
The easiest way to do that is to allow the device to fail the
WRITE_STATUS command by posting a command reject.
See \ref{
}.

virtio-ring: comment fixup
    
virtio_ring.h included with spec has this text:
/* Support for avail_idx and used_idx fields */
it should really refer to avail_event and used_event.
See \ref{

document idx field in virtqueue used ring

Section 2.4.8 The Virtqueue Used Ring
lists the idx field, but never documents it.
