OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes
it has patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by
implementations of this OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS
Standard, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication
of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such patent claims in a
manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee
that produced this specification.

OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is
aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would
necessarily be infringed by implementations of this specification by a
patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent
claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical
Committee that produced this specification. OASIS may include such
claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.

OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain
to the implementation or use of the technology described in this
document or the extent to which any license under such rights might or
might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any
effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS' procedures
with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by an
OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of
claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary
rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Committee Specification
or OASIS Standard, can be obtained from the OASIS TC Administrator.
OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of
intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any
claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.
